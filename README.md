# End-to-End-Learning-for-Self-Driving-Cars
In this project, I used a deep neural network (built with [Keras](https://keras.io/)) to clone car driving behavior.**  **The dataset used to train the network is generated from [Udacity's Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim), and it consists of images taken from three different camera angles (Center - Left - Right), in addition to the steering angle, throttle, brake, and speed during each frame.**  **The network is based on NVIDIA's paper [End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316v1.pdf), which has been proven to work in this problem domain.
